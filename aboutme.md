title: About me
subtitle: A Data Scientist with Research Experience
---

My name is Jingjing Shi. I'm currently a Data Science graduate student at Duke University. My interests include data management in research, deep learning in medical images, and data analysis. I'm also part-time graduate research at Dr. Charles Nunn's lab, working on quantifying parasite richness across primates and identifying ecological predictors of parasitism. My project also includes predicting missing interactions by integrating PGLS regression and network-based approaches.

I love teaching. I'm a teaching assistant for the Fundamentals of Data Science at Duke University. My responsibilities include creating sample answers, grading homework, and holding office hours. I have also been a teaching assistant of General Chemistry Lab (I and II) for 5 years at Penn State University, I was awarded the 'Chemistry Graduate Teaching Award' in 2016.

I'm also a motivated and highly professional biochemistry researcher with 7+ years of experience. I graduated from Penn State University, University Park with a master of science from the Department of Chemistry. My research includes identified two potential vaccine target RNA sites in poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, provided an alternative way of rational designing RNA viruses vaccine. I'm an expert in biochemistry benchwork and large-molecule NMR experiments. I'm seeking to leverage two sets of skills for a data scientist position in a chemical or healthcare company. 

### My story

I grew up in China, 

I went to Nanjing University for my undergraduate, I majored in Chemistry during my undergraduate study. I did lots of volunteer work during my college, including Nanjing University 110 anniversary and Nanjing Youth Olympic. I was the leader of the Jiangwenruo Volunteer Group for two years. I was awarded as an excellent volunteer several times, and I was awarded outstanding graduates at the time of graduation.

After graduation, I started my graduate study at Penn State University, with a full-amount assistantship from Penn State. I received the Troxell Scholarship in Chemistry in 2016. I went to the Protein Society in 2018 and presented my research as a poster during the conference.

During my research time at Penn State, I have been thinking about the innovations of data management systems in research. Most of the labs still utilize Excels as their main data storage resource, which may need an upgrade. I hope to incorporate my research experience to facilitate the development of electronic data storage transition.
